## About the patent


Manufacturers have been looking for effective methods to combat the Counterfeit of clothes, such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) authentication, 
because it is efficient and wireless. Proof of the legitimacy of the product by radio frequency technology not only benefits the industry, 
but also it benefits the retail store owners and even end customers. Over the years RFID has been replaced by NFC technology in means of product validation. 
It offers less cost and more convenience, beside this, it isn't necessary to use specific equipment, and several mobile devices 
for example (smartphones and tablets) currently feature NFC communication technology. The NFC technology operates by proximity field, with  approximately 10 cm distance.


The system contains a tag which will be sewn into the seal and inside it will contain the NFC electronic chip which can be washed with water without damage.
 The system consists of the data acquisition software in the mobile device with NFC technology for reading and writing data, 
 by wireless communication by proximity field. In the system server is required with a database that will store the clothing information and make its data available in the cloud. 
 However, for authentication to be performed, the database must in advance contain the initial attributes of the tag, such as the identification and the initial authentication key.
