The <a href="http://authenticxp.com/">Authentic XP</a> is a Startup company which offers a safe and efficient way for verifying the originality of your products, mainly clothes, from the factory to the final consumer.
The Authenticxp uses a NFC (Near-Field Communication) to do the authentication between the clothe's tag and the device.


## About the anti-counterfeit using NFC


The Manufacturers have been looking for effective methods to combat the Counterfeit of clothes, such as RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) authentication, 
because it is efficient and wireless. The proof of the legitimacy of the product by radio frequency technology not only benefits the industry, 
but also it benefits the retail store owners and even end customers. Over the years RFID has been replaced by NFC technology in the field of product validation. 
It offers less cost and more convenience, beside this, it isn't necessary to use specific equipment, and several mobile devices 
for example (smartphones and tablets) currently feature NFC communication technology. The NFC technology operates by proximity field, with  approximately 10 cm distance.


The system contains a tag which will be sewn into the seal and inside it will contain the NFC electronic chip which can be washed with water without damage.
 The system consists of the data acquisition software in the mobile device with NFC technology for reading and writing data, 
 by wireless communication by proximity field. In the system server is required a database that will store the clothing information and make its data available in the cloud. 
 However, for authentication to be performed, the database must contain the initial attributes of the tag, such as the identification and the initial authentication key.

The target of the counterfeit can be the tag nfc too, so besides the falsification of the clothes the counterfeiters can pirace the key authentication of the tag.
 So in the case for more safety authentication the dynamic key authentication is a good solution for this problem. 
Changing the dynamic key by authentication serves as an anti-piracy system against duplicating the tag code of the original
 clothing for a pirate clothing. In this case, at the time the retailer performs the validation process, the authentication key together
 with the code authentication related to the clothing will be changed, in the server database and in the electronic tag, thus blocking the possibility
 of authentication of any pirate clothing previously to this moment. Thus, if the validation process is performed on pirated clothing, it will
 show that the authentication key is different from the current one found in the database and that the clothing is forged (adulterated). In contrast, if the
 retailer who recive the clothes performs the authentication process and verifies that the authentication key has already been modified, then
 authentication has already been made previously, so it is necessary to contact the industry which provides the clothes.
